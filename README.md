**This code is based on the implementation of  [DARTS](https://github.com/quark0/darts).**

**Our approach is memory efficient:(i) batch-size is increased to further accelerate the search on CIFAR10, (ii) directly search on ImageNet.**

**Searched on ImageNet, we achieved currently one of, if not only, the best performance on ImageNet (24.2%/7.3%) under the mobile setting!**

**The search process in CIFAR10 only requires 0.1 GPU-days, *i.e.*, ~3 hours on one Nvidia 1080ti.(1.5 hours on one Tesla V100)**

## Usage

To run our code, you only need one Nvidia 1080ti , and equip it with PyTorch 0.3.1 (python2). (Tesla V100 will be faster).
```
python train_search.py \\
```
#### The evaluation process simply follows that of DARTS.

###### Here is the evaluation on CIFAR10/100:

```
python train_cifar.py \\
       --auxiliary \\
       --cutout \\
```

###### Here is the evaluation on ImageNet (mobile setting):
```
python train_imagenet.py \\
       --tmp_data_dir /path/to/your/data \\
       --save log_path \\
       --auxiliary \\
       --note note_of_this_run
```
We will provide pre-trained models of the discovered architecture on CIFAR10 and ImageNet soon!.
